Patterns are a special syntac for matching against the structure of types.
Using patterns w/ match expressions gives more control over program control flow.

A pattern consists of some combo of the following:
    • Literals
    • Destructured arrays, enums, structs, tuples
    • Variables
    • Wildcards
    • Placeholders
i.e. x or (a, 3) or Some(Color::Red)

In the contexts in which patterns are valid, these components describe the 'shape' of the data.
The program matches values against the patterns to determine if it has the correct 'shape' of data to continue running some code.

To use a pattern, compare it to a value. If pattern matches value, we can use the value and run some code on it.
