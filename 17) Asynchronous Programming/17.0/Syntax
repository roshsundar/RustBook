Rust asynchronous programming use futures, async, and await.

A future is some value that isn't ready now, but will be in the future.
futures are types that impl the Future trait.
Each future holds info abt its progress and when it's considered 'ready'.

async keyword can be applied to blocks and functions to specify that they can be interrupted and resumed.
Within said block/function, you can use the await keyword to wait for a future to be ready. It pauses and eventually resumes.

Rust compiles async and await code into equivalent code using the Future trait.
You can use it and impl it for your own types.
