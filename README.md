# RustBook

Code exercises following the Brown University edition of the [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/title-page.html)

The editor used was vscode with the following core extensions: [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer), [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb), [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml), and [Dependi](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fill-labs.dependi).
The [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) and [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) extensions were helpful.
